    <p><b>Workplace safety in the IT industry
    </b></p>
    <p>The Information Technology (IT) industry, characterized by its dynamic and innovative nature, presents a distinct
        set of workplace safety considerations.
        While many general safety principles apply, specific areas of concern deserve special attention in the IT
        sector.
        Here's a closer look at the necessary and unique safety information for the IT industry:
    </p>
